# 03_ROUTER_MIDDLEWARE_VIEWS — Router, middleware, view renderer

Implement the routing system and basic middleware pattern.

## Requirements
- Custom Router class supporting:
  - GET/POST routes
  - route params
  - named routes (optional)
- Middleware support:
  - auth required
  - role/permission checks (stubs for now)
- View rendering helper with:
  - layouts
  - escaping helpers

## Create/update
- /app/Http/Router.php
- /app/Http/Request.php
- /app/Http/Response.php
- /app/Http/Middleware/*.php
- /app/View/View.php
- /routes/web.php
- /public/index.php
- /views/* (create a few pages: home, login placeholder)

## Deliverable
All file contents.
